# Amazon Dynamic Groups - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Which Script Do I Run?

### **START HERE** ‚Üí Test Script
```powershell
.\Azure-AmazonDynamicGroupTest.ps1
```
- **What it does**: Tests with 1 store (store 0002 by default)
- **Safe**: Won't create groups unless you uncomment the creation code
- **Purpose**: Validate everything works before running batch operations

### **Then Choose One:**

#### Option A: Create NEW Groups
```powershell
.\Azure-AmazonDynamicGroupCreation.ps1
```
- **When to use**: You need to create Amazon groups for the first time
- **What it does**: Creates groups for all 170+ stores in your CSV
- **Result**: New groups like "Store 0002 - Amazon Delivery"

#### Option B: Update EXISTING Groups  
```powershell
.\Azure-AmazonDynamicGroupManagement.ps1
```
- **When to use**: You already have Amazon groups and want to update their rules
- **What it does**: Finds existing groups and updates their membership rules
- **Result**: Updated membership rules for existing groups

## üîß Quick Configuration

### Test Script Configuration
Edit line 12 in `Azure-AmazonDynamicGroupTest.ps1`:
```powershell
$testStore = "0002"  # Change to any store number from your CSV
```

### Excluded Stores
Edit the `$excludedLocations` array in any script to skip specific stores:
```powershell
$excludedLocations = @("9501", "1234")  # Add store numbers to exclude
```
